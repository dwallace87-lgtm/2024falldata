    <!-- Context -->
    <h2 class="section-heading">Context</h2>
    <div class="intro-text">
      This lesson opens our <strong>Enlightenment and Revolutions</strong> unit for 5th period at Franklin County High School.
      It builds directly from yesterday's <span class="highlight">diagnostic pre assessment</span> on Enlightenment ideas,
      which gave me a baseline for what students already understand and where they are confused.
      In that pre assessment, most students recognized the phrase <em>natural rights</em> but were less confident with
      terms like <em>social contract</em> and <em>consent of the governed</em>.
      Several students with IEPs and multilingual learners left the short response blank or wrote very brief answers.
      <br /><br />
      Today I want to <strong>hook students with a visual</strong>, build shared language around
      <span class="highlight">inalienable rights</span>, and give every student an accessible way to join the conversation.
      The lesson uses the workshop model that my classes know well: mini lesson, guided practice, independent work,
      and share/closure, with supports built in for SPED and MLL students.

    <!-- Objectives -->
    <h2 class="section-heading">Objectives</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>
        Students will be able to <strong>identify and define inalienable rights</strong>
        and give at least three examples in writing.
      </li>

        Students will be able to <strong>locate rights language</strong> in short adapted excerpts from
        Locke, the Declaration of Independence, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Students will be able to <strong>pose at least one question</strong> they still have about rights,
        which will guide future lessons and small group support.

            Connect their ideas to the Age of Reason and introduce the phrase
