    <!-- Context -->
    <h2 class="section-heading">Context</h2>
    <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        In the previous lesson, 5th period completed a short <strong>diagnostic pre assessment</strong> on Enlightenment and government. The assessment included
        <span class="highlight">8 multiple choice items</span> on core concepts (natural rights, social contract, consent of the governed, separation of powers),
        <span class="highlight">1 matching cluster</span> where students paired thinkers like Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire with simplified descriptions of their ideas,
        and <span class="highlight">1 short constructed response</span> based on a Locke style prompt:
        <em>“Why might Enlightenment writers argue that people have the right to challenge their government?”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That pre assessment confirmed what I see day to day: most students could recognize some rights language in answer choices, but many struggled to explain those ideas in their own words.
        I used the item results to note common misconceptions (for example, confusing “rights” with “privileges”) and to make early decisions about small group support for reading and writing.
        Students who showed very limited understanding on the constructed response are seated closer to the front or near peers who can model strong note taking in this lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
        5th period is a lively group right after lunch; several students come in chatty but engaged. Reading levels range from about 7th–10th grade.
        My four IEP students benefit from chunked text, verbal directions, and graphic organizers. The four MLLs are comfortable speaking in English but need explicit vocabulary and the option
        to jot notes in Spanish. GSSP students usually finish quickly and like being given a leadership role (for example, scribing on the class chart).
      </p>
      <p>
        This lesson <strong>stages the compelling question</strong> –
        <span class="highlight"><strong>“How did Reason lead to Revolution?”</strong></span> –
        by having students surface their own ideas about rights and then compare those ideas with short excerpts from Locke, the Declaration of Independence, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen.
        Their notebook quick writes and “Rights Chart” today build on the previous day’s diagnostic data and give me a more qualitative baseline on how comfortably they can talk about inalienable rights in their own words.

        <strong>HS.WH.CH.6</strong> – lesson introduces how views of government power and legitimacy shift when people believe they have natural rights.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>HS.WH.I.UC.3</strong> – students use evidence from sources (three excerpts) in their charts and written responses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>HS.WH.KH.1</strong> – brief connection from Enlightenment rights language to Kentucky’s early constitutional protections, such as religious freedom.

            Respond to a final prompt:
            <em>“Circle the right on your list that feels most important to you and be ready to explain why next class.”</em>
          </td>
          <td>
            Quick “fist to five” confidence check:
            <em>“How confident are you that you could explain what an inalienable right is?”</em>
            This gives a fast read on whole class comfort before SQ1 tomorrow.

            students can name without support. Record quick tallies (0–1 rights, 2–3 rights, 4+ rights) in my data tracker.

            Glance at charts from at least 6–8 students across ability levels.
            If many have only “life and liberty,” I know I need to reteach lesser known rights such as security
            or resistance to oppression before moving on.

        <strong>Note:</strong> No summative assessment happens in this single lesson.
        Content knowledge baseline comes from the previous day’s diagnostic pre assessment
        (8 multiple choice items, 1 matching cluster, 1 constructed response on Locke).
        Today’s quick writes and Rights Charts provide additional qualitative baseline data on how students
        describe inalienable rights in their own words before we move deeper into the inquiry.
