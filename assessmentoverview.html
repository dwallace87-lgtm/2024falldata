      <div class="info-value">
        10th Grade World History at Franklin County High School in Frankfort, Kentucky.
      </div>

      <div class="info-label">Team context</div>
      <div class="info-value">
        I teach World History as part of a small team. During the 2024 to 2025 school year I ran this inquiry in parallel with my colleague 
        <strong>Stephanie Morrell</strong>, who taught her own World History sections. We planned around the same Kentucky Academic Standards 
        and general pacing, but this performance task and data set reflect <strong>only my 118 students</strong> across five sections.
      </div>

      <div class="info-label">Unit focus</div>
      <div class="info-value">
        An inquiry on the Enlightenment and political revolutions centered on the compelling question 
        <strong>"How did Reason lead to Revolution?"</strong>
      </div>

      <div class="info-label">Timeline</div>
      <div class="info-value">
        Early in the first semester, over about three weeks. For most students this was their 
        <strong>first formal historical argument essay</strong> of the year.
      </div>

      <div class="info-label">Standards alignment</div>
      <div class="info-value">
        Aligned to the Kentucky Academic Standards for Social Studies (High School World History) in areas that address the Enlightenment, 
        changing views of government and legitimacy, political revolutions, and inquiry based argument writing. The performance task asked 
        students to interpret sources, trace cause and effect, and construct an evidence based written argument.
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      I used an Inquiry Design Model structure for this work. Students engaged with a compelling question, several supporting questions, 
      primary and secondary sources, and a final argument performance task. The goal was to introduce them to the kind of inquiry and 
      writing Kentucky expects in high school World History, while still giving them enough scaffolding to feel successful early in the year.
    </p>

    <!-- Students and classes -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Students and classes included</h2>

    <p>
      This assessment overview covers <strong>118 students</strong> across five World History sections:
    </p>

    <ul class="bullet-tight">
      <li>Period 1 - 24 students</li>
      <li>Period 2 - 23 students</li>
      <li>Period 3 - 26 students</li>
      <li>Period 5 - 26 students</li>
      <li>Period 7 - 19 students (a smaller class with a mix of students who needed additional support and a few strong peer models)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These rosters included multilingual learners, students with IEPs, and students with significant attendance challenges. I collaborated 
      with <strong>Hannah Bennett</strong>, one of our special education teachers, who works with several of these students during her class 
      period. Hannah and I stayed in touch about organizers, vocabulary supports, and expectations so that students felt the connection between 
      her class and mine rather than experiencing two completely separate worlds.
    </p>

    <!-- Learning goals -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Learning goals</h2>

    <div class="callout">
      <div class="callout-tag">Big idea</div>
      <div class="callout-text">
        I wanted students to move beyond memorizing names and dates and start to explain how ideas travel, how people challenge power, 
        and how revolutions connect to arguments about rights and government.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="subheading">Content goals</h3>
    <ul class="bullet-tight">
      <li>
        Describe key Enlightenment ideas such as natural rights, social contract, separation of powers, and religious tolerance in accessible language.
      </li>
      <li>
        Connect Enlightenment ideas to political revolutions, especially the American and French Revolutions, by explaining how new ideas about 
        rights and government challenged older systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Recognize that Enlightenment and revolution look different in different regions, and that the outcomes of revolutions are not always simple or positive.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="subheading">Disciplinary and inquiry goals</h3>
    <ul class="bullet-tight">
      <li>
        Work with short, adapted primary and secondary sources to pull out main ideas and relevant evidence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Explain cause and effect in writing, not just list events. For example, explain how natural rights theory can lead people to question a monarch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use an argument structure that includes a clear claim, supporting reasons, and specific evidence from sources.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="subheading">Literacy and writing goals</h3>
    <ul class="bullet-tight">
      <li>
        Plan and write a multi paragraph argument essay that answers the compelling question and stays focused on that question.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use at least two sources to support the argument and explain the evidence rather than just dropping in quotes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Organize writing with basic transitions and maintain readable sentence structure, even if students are still building more advanced style.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Assessment plan -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Assessment plan and evidence sources</h2>

    <h3 class="subheading">Diagnostic pre assessment</h3>
    <p>
      Before we launched the full inquiry, students completed a short pre assessment on Enlightenment and government to give me a baseline. 
      The pre assessment included:
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet-tight">
      <li><strong>Eight multiple choice questions</strong> on core ideas like natural rights, social contract, and the purpose of government.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>One matching cluster</strong> that asked students to connect thinkers such as Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire to simplified 
        descriptions of their ideas.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>One short constructed response</strong> that asked: In your own words, why might Enlightenment writers argue that people have 
        the right to challenge their government?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Students had access to a short adapted passage or textbook style explanation, but they did not receive sentence starters for this pre assessment. 
      I wanted a clear picture of how they explained ideas without heavy scaffolds yet. Those scores became the baseline in the data file.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subheading">Formative tasks during the inquiry</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout the unit, students completed several formative tasks that built toward the final essay:
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet-tight">
      <li>
        A jigsaw reading on major Enlightenment thinkers, where each group read a short adapted text and then taught their classmates the 
        main idea in simple language.
      </li>
      <li>
        Source analysis stations that asked students to highlight evidence and answer focused questions about how each source viewed government and power.
      </li>
      <li>
        A planning organizer that guided students to write a claim, list reasons, and match each reason to at least one source.
      </li>
      <li>
        A practice body paragraph, written together in class, that modeled how to connect an Enlightenment idea to a specific change during a revolution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These formative checkpoints were scored for completion and basic quality. They helped me decide where to slow down or re model 
      before the summative essay.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subheading">Summative performance task</h3>
    <p>
      The culminating task for this inquiry was a written argument essay in response to the question
      <strong>"How did Reason lead to Revolution?"</strong>
      Students wrote in class using their notes and organizers. They were expected to:
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet-tight">
      <li>State a clear claim that directly answers the question.</li>
      <li>Use at least two sources from the unit, cited in simple, student friendly ways.</li>
      <li>Explain how Enlightenment ideas influenced political revolutions, not just list facts.</li>
      <li>Organize their writing into an introduction, body paragraphs, and a brief conclusion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I scored essays with a four part rubric that focused on <strong>claim and focus, use of evidence, historical reasoning,</strong> and 
      <strong>writing conventions</strong>. This is the same rubric I planned to use again later in the course so I could track growth over time.
    </p>

    <!-- Support and differentiation -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Support, differentiation, and collaboration</h2>

    <h3 class="subheading">Support for multilingual learners and students with IEPs</h3>
    <p>
      For multilingual learners and students with IEPs, I created adjusted versions of the graphic organizers with sentence stems and small word banks. 
      I also front loaded key vocabulary in short warm ups so students could hear and use the language before they saw it in the texts. During the writing process, 
      I pulled small groups to rehearse ideas out loud before they tried to put everything on paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I coordinated these supports with <strong>Hannah Bennett</strong>, who works with several of the same students in a different class period. 
      We shared organizers and talked about which sentence stems and routines were working, so students felt some continuity instead of starting from scratch 
      every time they shifted from her room to mine.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subheading">Support for attendance challenges</h3>
    <p>
      I also planned short catch up pathways for students with significant absences. For each key formative task, I created a shorter version that a student 
      could complete during advisory or at home. This allowed them to at least experience the core reading and writing moves before they attempted the essay. 
      Those catch up tasks are referenced in my data and analysis documents, since attendance shows up clearly in the outcomes.
    </p>

    <!-- How this document fits into the packet -->
    <h2 class="section-title">How this overview connects to the data and analysis</h2>

    <p>
      This overview is the first piece in a three part packet:
    </p>

    <ul class="bullet-tight">
      <li>
        <strong>Document 1 – Assessment Overview</strong> (this page) describes the context, goals, and assessment design for the Enlightenment and Revolution inquiry.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document 2 – Assessment Data</strong> provides the class averages, rubric distributions, proficiency bands, and group level results for all 118 students.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document 3 – Analysis and Instructional Planning</strong> explains what I learned from the data and how I adjusted instruction for the next unit.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Together, these three parts show my students early in the year, the work they produced, and the way I respond to real data rather than the version 
      of the class I might imagine in my head.
    </p>

    <p class="footnote">
      Note: Numbers and group counts in this packet reflect assessment data for the 2024 to 2025 school year for my World History sections at Franklin County High School.
