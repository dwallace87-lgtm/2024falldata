    <p>
      Students completed a short diagnostic pre assessment on core Enlightenment ideas and then wrote a structured argument essay
      responding to the compelling question
      <strong>"How did Reason lead to Revolution?"</strong>
      using evidence from texts we read together. The goal here is not to present end-of-year writing, but to show
      realistic early-year growth in my classes at Franklin County and to explain how I used the results to shape the next unit.

    <!-- What the data show -->
    <h2 class="section-title">What the data show</h2>

    <div class="callout">
      <div class="callout-tag">Big picture</div>
      <div class="callout-text">
        Across three sections, the overall average moved from about
        <strong>55%</strong> on the pre assessment to
        <strong>72%</strong> on the first argument essay. A lot of students
        moved out of the lowest band, but many are still in the developing range and need more practice with reading and writing
        about history.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="subheading">Overall growth across classes</h3>
    <p>
      A total of <strong>75 students</strong> completed both the pre assessment and the summative essay. Class averages on the
      pre assessment ranged from <strong>52%</strong> to <strong>58%</strong>. Summative essay averages ranged from
      <strong>70%</strong> to <strong>75%</strong>. When I look at all students together, the average increased from about
      <strong>55%</strong> on the pre assessment to <strong>72%</strong> on the essay, a gain of roughly
      <strong>17 points</strong>.
      For a first attempt at this kind of writing, early in the year, that growth is meaningful, even though there is still plenty
      of room to grow.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subheading">Movement across proficiency bands</h3>
    <p>
      The pre assessment data made it clear that many students were starting from a low baseline. Roughly
      <strong>40%</strong> of students scored in the below basic range, and only about <strong>23%</strong> were at proficient
      or advanced. On the summative essay, the percentage of students in the below basic band dropped to about
      <strong>16%</strong>, while the share of students at proficient or advanced rose to a little over
      <strong>45%</strong>. Students in the basic band remained the largest group.
    </p>

    <table aria-label="Proficiency bands before and after">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Band</th>
          <th>Pre assessment (approx.)</th>
          <th>Summative essay (approx.)</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Below basic</td>
          <td>About 40%</td>
          <td>About 16%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Basic</td>
          <td>Roughly mid 30s%</td>
          <td>High 30s%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Proficient</td>
          <td>About 18%</td>
          <td>Low 30s%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Advanced</td>
          <td>About 5%</td>
          <td>Low teens%</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Taken together, this tells me that the unit helped a significant number of students move out of the lowest band,
      which matters for confidence and access. At the same time, many students are still in the middle range and need continued
      support to build more precise reading and writing skills.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subheading">Strengths and needs by rubric skill</h3>
    <p>
      Each essay was scored with a four-part rubric on a 1-4 scale (Beginning, Developing, Proficient, Advanced). Looking at the
      categories separately gave me a clearer picture of what students could already do and where they were struggling.
    </p>

    <table aria-label="Rubric skill snapshot">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Rubric skill</th>
          <th>Overall takeaway from the first essay</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Claim and focus</strong></td>
          <td>
            A little more than half of students scored at proficient or advanced. Most could state a basic answer to the question
            and stick with it, even if their reasoning still needed more depth.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Use of evidence</strong></td>
          <td>
            Around 44% of students reached proficient or advanced. Many essays included general statements like
            "The Enlightenment brought new ideas" without naming specific thinkers or documents. Students need more practice
            pulling concrete evidence from the texts we use in class.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Historical reasoning</strong></td>
          <td>
            This was the weakest category, with only about 37% of students at proficient or above. A common pattern was listing
            an Enlightenment idea and then naming a revolution without clearly explaining the cause and effect relationship.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Writing conventions</strong></td>
          <td>
            This was comparatively stronger. About 60% of students were proficient or advanced. Most could organize their writing
            into basic paragraphs and write understandable sentences, which is a solid starting point for the first essay of the year.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3 class="subheading">Patterns for different student groups</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="tagged-text-strong">Multilingual learners and students with IEPs.</span>
      These students started well below the overall average, with pre assessment scores in the low to mid 40s. On the essay,
      their averages rose into the low to mid 60s. They actually made slightly larger gains than the class as a whole,
      which suggests that the vocabulary supports and structured writing organizers built into the unit were helpful.
      Even with that growth, they still scored below peers, so they remain a focal group for the next unit.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="tagged-text-strong">Chronically absent students.</span>
      Students who had missed ten or more days during the term had the lowest scores overall. Their pre assessment average was in
      the high 30s, and their essay average rose to the high 50s. They did grow about 19 points, but many remained in the below
      basic or basic bands. When I compared their scores with completion data for formative tasks, it was clear that inconsistent
      attendance meant they missed key modeling and practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="tagged-text-strong">Students with regular attendance and no IEP or MLL designation.</span>
      These students started higher and ended higher, with averages rising from around 60% to the mid 70s. They still showed
      growth, but they also highlighted the gap that can open up quickly if other students do not receive enough targeted support.
    </p>

    <!-- How I used the results -->
    <h2 class="section-title">How I used the results to adjust instruction</h2>

    <p>
      After reviewing the numbers and reading through a sample of essays, I made some specific choices about what needed to change
      in the next unit on revolutions and nation building. The main goal was to keep the structure that helped students grow, while
      tightening the parts that left too much room for vague or surface-level writing.
    </p>

    <ul class="adjustment-list">
      <li>
        <span class="adjustment-title">Re teaching historical reasoning with step-by-step modeling.</span><br />
        Because historical reasoning was the lowest scoring rubric category, I designed an additional mini lesson that walked
        students through one example in detail. We took a short excerpt from John Locke and a short description of the American
        Revolution and wrote out, step by step, how the idea of natural rights could lead people to question a monarchy. I used
        color coding and sentence stems so students could see the difference between listing facts and actually explaining cause
        and effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="adjustment-title">Building stronger routines for using evidence.</span><br />
        To address weak evidence use, I adjusted my graphic organizers so that students had to write the title or author of the
        source in one box and then pull a short quote or paraphrase into another box before planning their paragraphs. In the next
        unit, I also built in a simple routine called "Name it, Use it, Explain it." Students first name the source, then use a
        specific detail, and finally explain how it supports their claim. That routine mirrors the rubric language and helps them
        see what strong evidence actually looks like in their writing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="adjustment-title">Adding targeted scaffolds for multilingual learners and students with IEPs.</span><br />
        For multilingual learners and students with IEPs, I created modified versions of the writing organizer with sentence
        starters and a small word bank. I also planned to introduce key vocabulary in a short warm up instead of waiting until
        we were already in the reading. In small groups, we practiced turning simple notes into complete sentences together so
        that students could experience some success before moving into independent writing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="adjustment-title">Creating catch-up pathways for chronically absent students.</span><br />
        Because absences clearly affected performance, I pulled the most important formative tasks into short catch-up packets.
        The packets are designed so that a student can complete them during advisory or at home and still get the essential
        reading and writing practice they missed. I also started keeping a simple tracking sheet for who still needs to finish
        which key tasks.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Ongoing monitoring -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Ongoing monitoring and goals</h2>

    <p>
      I am using the same four-part argument rubric for the next major writing task so that I can compare results over time.
      My goal is to increase the percentage of students who are proficient or advanced in historical reasoning from about
      <strong>37%</strong> to at least <strong>60%</strong> by mid year, and to narrow the gap between focal student groups and
      the overall average. I also plan to share a simplified version of this data with students so they can see their own growth
      and set personal goals for the next essay.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scores from this unit are not where I ultimately want them to be, but they give me a realistic early-year snapshot of
      my students at Franklin County High School. This analysis has pushed me to be more intentional about modeling, scaffolding,
      and follow up support as we move deeper into the World History curriculum.
